Problem Statement: 

Hotel manager has shared a hotel dataset containing Resort and City hotel data from 2015 to 2017, their central interest is to get insight from the year 2016 under resort hotel during the summer period (July and August). Although they need to see insight on other months too.
 
 KPIs: 
 1) Cancellation level
 2) Average daily rate
 3) Revenue generated
 4) Revenue lost

Insights:

1) There is an increase in revenue in July and August and also lost to cancelltaion, $991K were lost to cancellation in July and August
2) Average daily rate is higher in July and August with low Cancellation, we have high cancellation in January, March and  November.
3) High cancellation falls between  Monday and Saturday 
4) Summer booking within 30 days high cancellation, it might be affected by the high Average daily rate

Key Recommendations:

1) We can over booked the summer month reservation, with that we can reduce cancellations
2) Focus more on the booking between 0-30days during the summer period(July and August)
3) Reducing the Avg daily rate  might reduce cancellations

1) Created an interactive dashboard to track and analyze Hotel Booking data.
2) Created power point dashboard template for  dashboard purpose.
3) Created different measures to calculate Key Performance indicator like Total Revenue, Cancellation rate, Average Daily rate, Revenue Loss
4) Used different types of DAX expressions to create Date master table, with the help Date master table we can calculate time series Analysis easily
